## Early Life and Background

Al-Khwarizmi was born around 780 CE in Khwarazm (modern-day Uzbekistan). He later moved to Baghdad and worked at the House of Wisdom (Bayt al-Hikma), a major center for translation, study, and scientific innovation under the Abbasid Caliphate.

At the House of Wisdom, scholars from various cultures collaborated to preserve and expand upon Greek, Persian, and Indian knowledge. Within this environment, al-Khwarizmi produced works that made him one of the most influential mathematicians in history.

## Contributions to Mathematics

### Algebra

Al-Khwarizmi’s most famous work is *Al-Kitab al-Mukhtasar fi Hisab al-Jabr wal-Muqabala* ("The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing"). This book presented systematic methods for solving linear and quadratic equations.

The word "al-jabr" from the title became the modern term "algebra." Al-Khwarizmi treated algebra as an independent discipline, not just a set of arithmetic techniques.

### Arithmetic and Algorithms

He introduced the Hindu-Arabic numeral system to the Western world. Through Latin translations, Europe gradually adopted positional decimal notation, replacing Roman numerals.

His name, Latinized as "Algoritmi," became the origin of the word "algorithm," forming the foundation of modern computer science.

## Contributions to Geography and Astronomy

In geography, al-Khwarizmi revised and corrected earlier works, including those of Ptolemy. His book *Kitab Surat al-Ard* ("The Image of the Earth") improved geographical coordinates and knowledge of the known world.

In astronomy, he compiled astronomical tables (zij) that were widely used in the Islamic world and Europe, contributing to observational astronomy and timekeeping.

## Historical Impact

Al-Khwarizmi’s writings were translated into Latin in the 12th century and became standard texts in European universities. His methods shaped medieval scholarship and influenced Renaissance science.

He is widely regarded as:  
- A founder of algebra  
- A pioneer of algorithmic thinking  
- A key scholar of the Islamic Golden Age

## Legacy

Al-Khwarizmi’s influence extends far beyond his lifetime. Modern mathematics, engineering, cryptography, and computer programming trace part of their intellectual heritage to his work.

More than a millennium later, his ideas remain embedded in the structure of modern science and technology.
